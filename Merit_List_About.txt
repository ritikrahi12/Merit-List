This project analyzes the selection process of students in a competitive exam using Python and Pandas in Jupyter Notebook. The dataset consists of 200 students, including their exam scores and Physical Fitness Test (PFT) results. Initially, the dataset was randomly generated through ChatGPT, and then manually refined by creating realistic scenarios for shortlisting based on performance.

Through data analysis, the project identifies patterns and key factors influencing selection, ultimately filtering the top 30 students who qualify. Various data manipulation and visualization techniques are applied to gain insights into performance trends and selection criteria.

This project demonstrates the practical application of data analytics in decision-making, making it valuable for evaluating merit-based selection processes.
